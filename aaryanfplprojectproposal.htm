    <h1>Aaryan's FPL Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Objective of the Website</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to design and implement a website dedicated to Fantasy Premier League (FPL) management and analysis. The site will provide users with tools and insights to optimize their FPL teams. Key features will include player performance analytics, fixture schedules, and personalized recommendations based on user-selected criteria. The site aims to help FPL managers make informed decisions and improve their overall performance in the league. Furthermote given that it is something I myself have played for many years with my friends as we are all passionate fans, I'd like to have an opinion column where I can share information from users, friends and other individuals across various social media platofrms all in one page on my website.
