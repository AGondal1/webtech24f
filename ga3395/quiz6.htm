    <h1>Animate the Box (25 points)</h1>
	<!-- You are asked to animate the box provided where the box travels from 
	     the bottom to the top of the screen. You can set the initial position
		 of the box to 400px on the vertical axis and 200px on the horizontal
		 axis (i.e. 400px from the top and 200 from the left).
		 Move the box towards the top (from the bottom). When the box reaches
		 the top (say 100px), move the box 100px further left and restart 
		 the movement from bottom to top by resetting the vertical axis to 400px
		 (the inital setting). When it reaches 800px on the horizontal
		 axis, reset the horizontal to 200px (inital setting).
		 The grading is as follows: (1) Setup for the function to work (5), 
		 (2) moving the box from bottom to top (10), resetting the vertical (5)
		 and resetting the horizontal (5).
		 NOTE: If you add code here that you cannot explain, even if you say that you
        used this code from gen-AI for practice, IF you cannot explain the code 
        to me you will not be given credit. I have to be fair to those students in the 
        class that resort to original effort instead of relying on external sources. 
        You will get more points for trying and failing than for successfully implementing
        code that is not yours. -->
