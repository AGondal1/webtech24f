    USDA has released the MyPyramid food guidance system (www.mypyramid.gov). Along with the
    new MyPyramid symbol, the system provides many options to help Americans make healthy food
    choices and to be active every day.

    Below is information that can help you navigate through the new
    MyPyramid system to educate consumers. These are physical activity,
    variety, proportionality, moderation, gradual improvement, and finally personalization. More
    information on these messages can be found on the
     "Anatomy of MyPyramid" handout (from http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/MyPyramid_Anatomy.pdf).
    The basic messages give consumers MyPyramid's basic messages about healthy eating
    and physical activity, which apply to everyone. These can be found on the miniposter and the website. 
    They mirror the messages from the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans consumer brochure.
