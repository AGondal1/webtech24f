	<h2 id="AA">About Aaryan</h2>
	<p>
		I’m Aaryan Gondal, home for me in Mumbai, India. I’m a rising Junior, who intends to do a dual concentration in Tech entrepreneurship and Marketing. 
        I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so I’m looking to use Babson as the foundation to either allow me to start something of my own or hone the necessary skills required to join an early-stage startup. 
        I'd to consider myself a big techie and someone interested in learning about the tech that makes our world tick.

        One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. Often, when I find myself having free time I play games on my phone or PlayStation in particularly games like FC/FIFA, Fortnite, formula 1, etc;. 
        Gaming not only acts as a form of relaxation for me, but it also gives me time to bond and connect with friends who might be away from me. 
        Funnily enough, my dad’s first company that he founded was a gaming company called India Games, so one could argue that I have gaming in my blood.
