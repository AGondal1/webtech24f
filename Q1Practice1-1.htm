        What is IoT? Source: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)
        <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
        The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings and other items—embedded 
with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data.[1] 
The IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,[2] creating 
opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved 
efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit;[3][4][5][6][7][8] when IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the
            
technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies 
such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable 
through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts 
estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.[9]
    
        Where did it start?
        British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton first coined the term in 1999 while working at Auto-ID Labs (originally called 
Auto-ID centers, referring to a global network of objects connected to radio-frequency identification, or RFID).[10] 
Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond 
machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.[11] The i
nterconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly 
all fields, while also enabling advanced applications like a smart grid,[12] and expanding to the areas such as 
smart cities.[13][14]
